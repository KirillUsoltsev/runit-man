Simple runit web management tool.

Server will run by runit-man.rb script.

Take a look at its options:
 -p - Port to listen (4567 by default)
 -b - IP Address to bind (0.0.0.0 by default)
 -a - Directory of activated services (/etc/service by default)
 -f - Directory of all known services (/etc/sv by default)

Usually you need thin or mongrel gem to run runit-man fine. 
  gem install thin

To run this service in runit too, use proposed run stripts in ./sv folder.

Any localization can be done by editing of ./i18n/*.yml locale files.

Yours sincerely,
  Akzhan.
