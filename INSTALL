You need ruby 1.8.6 or above and rubygems installed.

Use following command to install runit-man:
  gem install runit-man

Take a look at runit-man script options:

 -p - Port to listen (4567 by default)
 -b - IP Address to bind (0.0.0.0 by default)
 -a - Directory of activated services (/etc/service by default)
 -f - Directory of all known services (/etc/sv by default)
 -u - User and password delimited by ':' for HTTP authentication (disabled by default)
 -r - Register runit-man as runit service (as defined by other options)

Usually you need thin gem to run runit-man effectively.
  gem install thin

Any localization can be done by editing of ./i18n/*.yml locale files.
Contributions are welcome.
